# Speech-Recognition-Translation-model
This project implements a complete pipeline for speech recognition and translation using state-of-the-art machine learning models. The goal is to convert audio speech into text and subsequently translate it into another language using pretrained models available on Hugging Face.

Key Features:

    Speech-to-Text Conversion: Leveraging advanced speech recognition models to accurately transcribe spoken language into text.
    Text Translation: High-quality translation of transcribed text from the source language to the target language using a pretrained translation model.
    Hugging Face Deployment: The entire pipeline is deployed on Hugging Face, providing an API and web interface for easy interaction and real-time inference.

Project Objectives:

    Provide a robust solution for speech recognition and translation, facilitating multilingual applications.
    Simplify access to state-of-the-art models through Hugging Face integration.
    Enable seamless real-time interaction with the model via a web interface or API.
